Part of the Complete Unreal Creator course on Udemy, see [here](https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse?couponCode=GitHubSpecial) for a special GitHub offer. The full course is part of [this](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bentristem/learn-to-make-video-games-unreal-developer-course) Kickstarter campaign which was over 1000% funded.

These are just the files I made from the course, none of the tutorial videos. The course is exclusively hosted on Udemy.com.
